# emacs-config
My personal emacs configuration file.

### Prerequisite
This configuration best works with gnu emacs24 gui version. 

### Installation of emacs
To install gnu emacs gui version for mac use following link.
http://emacsformacosx.com/

Please make sure you don't have other emacs init file. For GnuEmacs init file could be at `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.el` or `~/.emacs.d/init.d`. If you have above init file then remove those. 

Add init.el file following to `~/.emacs.d/` location and restart emacs. Make sure to have internet connection.
